#The introduction of each folder
1. We used python version 3.9 and pytorch version 1.13.1.

2. The CML_classifer folder and ML_weights folder contains conventional machine learning classifiers(RF,  AdaBoost, and LightGBM) and the model weight information saved during model training and testing, respectively.

3. The code for the five-fold cross-validation, independent test, and image visualization is located in the Codes folder.

4. The Csv folder contains the training and test sets of various plants divided at 7:3 ratio.

5. There are the files of training sets and independent test sets in the Datasets folder, which also include the datasets after Cd-hit with 40% sequence identity.

6.
