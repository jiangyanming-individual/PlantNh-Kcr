We used python version 3.9 and pytorch version 1.13.1.

There are the files of training sets and independent test sets in the Datasets folder, which also include the datasets after Cd-hit with 40% sequence identity.

The code for the five fold cross-validation and independent test are PlantNh-Kcr_train.py and PlantNh-Kcr_ind_test.py, respectively.
